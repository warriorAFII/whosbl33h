        Faced with the challenge of unifying disparate entities acquired within
        a short span, Voyager Worldwide, a Maritime Navigation software company,
        hired our design agency to build a cohesive website consolidating
        content and products from various global businesses under the single
        Voyager Worldwide brand. With a complex task at hand, the goal was to
        create a unified platform that harmonised multiple websites into one,
        requiring a complete overhaul of site structure, user flows, and UI in
        just 30 days.
